703 Readme

Note that Ray Deneckere taught 703 for many years in the early 2000's.
Then, Nic Roays arrived and taught 703 in 2011, 2012, and 2013.
Now Deneckere has resumed teaching 703 as of Fall 2014.

HOWEVER, math camp should be low-stress for all of you - everyone gets
an A or AB. As a result, cohorts have been less diligent about saving
Math Camp material, so some midterms and finals are missing.

2017 Archivist: Generally all his test questions are pulled directly from past exams, so if you study those you'll be fine.
Don't stress about math camp.

2018 Archivist: John Kennan will be teaching 703 this year. It's hard to say whether and how he will differ from Ray Deneckere,
but the material should be similar. The course typically covers basic topics in analysis (at an undergraduate level) and 
introductory optimization theory. In the past, the course has followed Sundaram (1996) closely.

2019 Archivist: John Kennan will teach math camp again. He used Understanding Analysis by Stephen
 Abbott for last year. The course will cover a lot of important tools that will continually pop up
 during the year like contraction mapping theorem, Blackwell Sufficient Conditions, Separating 
Hyperplanes Theorems, etc. 

2020 Archivist: Anna Bykhovskaya will teach math camp this year instead of John Kennan. She is an entirely new professor and we cannot say how she will run the course.
